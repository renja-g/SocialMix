# SocialMix
The fundamental idea is to let you choose accounts from different social media platforms and combine them into one feed. For example, you might like to keep up with a certain creator, but they post on YouTube and X (Twitter) and have a podcast. You can add all of these accounts to your feed and see all of their content in one place.

This would also be useful for creators since they could put all of their accounts and secondary accounts from all platforms into one feed and share it via a link.
A bit like [link.space](https://link.space/) that lets you put all of your social media accounts into one link, but SocialMix would also show a combined feed of all of the accounts.

## Why did I not build it?
From what I observed, the most important platforms to integrate would be YouTube and X (Twitter), but since the X API has no reasonable pricing, I would not be able to integrate it. And without X, the project would not be as useful as I intended it to be.
